# README

This simple to-do list made on rails 6 has the following functionality:

- Adding items to the list
- Marking them as either completed or not (via the checkbox in the list)
- Input validation while adding items (cannot add empty descriptions)
- Deleting entries

Known Limitations

- Alerts cannot be cancelled (due to inconsistencies with using webpacker on rails 6 and bootstrap-sprockets)
